## **Features:**

- **AES-256 Encryption** (CBC mode with 128-bit blocks)  
  Industry-leading encryption standard for maximum security.
  
- **PBKDF2HMAC-SHA256 key derivation** (100,000 iterations)  
  Strengthens the encryption key for additional protection against brute-force attacks.
  
- **BCrypt password hashing** (salt+pepper protection)  
  Secure password hashing to guard against rainbow table and other password attacks.
  
- **Defense against brute force & rainbow table attacks**  
  Multi-layered defense ensuring the highest protection of sensitive data.
  
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Windows/macOS/Linux)  
  Works seamlessly across multiple operating systems.
  
- **Intuitive graphical interface** with progress tracking  
  Designed for ease of use with real-time encryption progress updates.
  
- **Secure password validation & strength checking**  
  Ensures that user passwords are strong and secure before encryption begins.

---

## **Security Highlights:**

- **FIPS 140-2 compliant cryptographic protocols**  
  Ensures compliance with government standards for data encryption.
  
- **Hardware accelerated encryption & decryption**  
  Optimized performance for faster, more efficient encryption and decryption processes.
  
- **Zero knowledge architecture** (no keys stored)  
  No encryption keys are stored, enhancing privacy and reducing the risk of key theft.
  
- **Automatic memory sanitization**  
  Memory used during encryption and decryption is automatically cleared to prevent data leakage.
  
- **Tamper-evident file integrity checks**  
  Protects against file corruption and tampering.
